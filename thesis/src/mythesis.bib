	within the framework of the linear tetrahedron method and the finite
	temperature density-functional theory, (b) iterative methods for
	the diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian and a discussion
	of an efficient iterative method based on the ideas of Pulays residual
	minimization, which is close to an order N&m scaling even for relatively
	large systems, (c) efficient Broyden-like and Pulay-like mixing methods
	for the charge density including a new special preconditioning optimized
	for a plane-wave basis set, (d) conjugate gradient methods for minimizing
	the electronic free energy with respect to all degrees of freedom
	simultaneously. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful
	package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamicspackage).
	The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a
	large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors,
	liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting
	surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors)
	and turned out to be very reliable.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Recently, two computational approaches that supply a density-functional-based
	quantum-chemical method with an empirical term accounting for London
	dispersion were introduced and found use in the studies of biomolecular
	systems, namely, DFT-D and SCC-DFTB-D. Here, we examine the performance
	and usability of these combined techniques for dealing with several
	tasks typically occurring in the research of biomolecules. The interaction
	energy of small biomolecular complexes agrees very well with the
	reference data yielded by correlated ab initio quantum chemical methods.
	In real-life studies aimed at interaction energy, structure, and
	infrared spectra, the mentioned methods provide results in good agreement
	with each other and with experiment (where available). The very favorable
	time demands of these approaches are discussed, and for each of them,
	a suitable area of use is proposed on the basis of the results of
	our analysis.},

  title = {{Introduction to the Keldysh Formalism and Applications to Time-Dependent
	Density-Functional theor}},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {706},
  abstract = {This paper gives an introduction to the Keldysh formalism, with emphasis
	on its usefulness in time-dependent density functional theory. In
	the rst part we introduce the Keldysh contour and the one-particle
	Green function dened on this contour. We then discuss how to combine
	and manipulate functions with time-arguments on the contour. The
	eects of electron-electron interaction can be taken systematically
	into account, as we illustrate by propagating the Kadano-Baym equations
	for the second-order self-energy approximation. It is important to
	use conserving approximations such that the evolution of the electron
	density, momentum, and total energy agrees with the macroscopic conservation
	laws. One of the main topics in this paper is the non-interacting
	Green function, which is the relevant quantity for time-dependent
	density functional theory. We discuss this Green function in detail,
	and show how the Keldysh contour in a simple way allows us to derive
	the time-dependent Kohn-Sham potential from an action functional.
	The formalism in a similar way leads to response functions that obey
	the causality principle. To illustrate these points, we discuss the
	time-dependent optimized eective potential equations.},

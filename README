1. General
2. How to install
-You will need cmake in order to install tdtb+uj. I did it with cmake 
2.4.4. you can download it from www.cmake.org and install it..
Two enviroment variables affect the behaviour FC and FFLAGS they will 
help you to set the fortran compiler and the flags necessary to compile.
(eg. export FC=ifort;export FFLAGS="-O3 -axT" for a Core2Duo 
processer with intel fortran compiler and bash-like shell or
setenv FC ifort; setenv FFLAGS="-O4  -axB" for a csh like shell)
----- cmake .
this will generate the Makefile if you want to install it in a certain 
location the command will be (cmake . -DPREFIX="/your_path")
----- make
this will build the binaries bin/tb+uj.x
----- make install 
this will install the binaries at the desired location
----- make uninstall 
this will uninstall the the program (will delete the files written by 
make install)
----- make docs
this will generate a documentation using doxygen 
(www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) you will need also 
pdflatex and makeindex.
